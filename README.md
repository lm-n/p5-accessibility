# p5-accessibility

### Overview

This is a library to make the p5 canvas accessible.

The canvas is an inherently inaccessible element in the web. This library tries to reconstruct what is on the canvas in p5 in words and sound so that it is accessible to the screen reader.

It helps create 3 kinds of output

1) **Plain Text Output** - This describes the visual content present in the canvas in list form. Each element can be selected so as to get more details

2) **Table Text Output** - Here the visual content in the canvas is laid out in the form of a table based on where each element is - the elements can be selected so as to get more details.

3) **Sound Output** - This mode explains the movement of the objects present in the canvas. Top to Down movement is represented by a decrease in frequency and left to right by panning the stereo output.
